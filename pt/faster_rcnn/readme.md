Try do this work from scratch, the faster-rcnn is actually an architecture for object detection. Even though Faster-RCNN is out dated but it still worth of take a deep inside it. and do some dirty work.


Will implement with those concept:

- always compatible with newest api of pytorch.
- code readable.
- module.
